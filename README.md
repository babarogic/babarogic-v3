1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this project. If you don't have the CLI installed already, see [Gastby instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli).

```sh
gatsby new YOUR-PROJECT-NAME https://github.com/margueriteroth/gatsby-prismic-starter-prist
```

2. **Start developing.**

Navigate into your new site's directory, install node modules, and start it up.

```sh
cd YOUR-PROJECT-NAME
npm install
gatsby develop
```
